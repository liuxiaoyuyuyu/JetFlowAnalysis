Header file
    include/
    3 header files: coordinate tools, constants, Tree details
    
Once changes are made to macro and header, back up one directory so you can see both src and include âmake cleanâ removes old executable. âMakeâ compiles new changes (very fast, not like scram b)

Make file
Change the name to reflect the macro you are working on, (change it in 5 locations)

Produces executable in âbinâ directory

Data file lists
    data_v2_list.txt, contains all paths to all files


Executable
Condor jobs in batch
    divides, gives args, etc
